What is this and why do you care?  

Well, perhaps you don't care.  Perhaps you shouldn't care.  But I feel obliged to write a few words about
myself and the intent of this site nonetheless.

I write software for a living.  Some might say that makes me a professional software engineer - but, since I
don't take myself too seriously, I wouldn't normally use the word _professional_ in reference to myself.
Anyway... during a post-mortem review for `$incident`, a few of us were talking about the response to this
issue.  The tl;dr is that we needed to write a _thing_ to update a database to recover from this incident.  My
colleagues were about to jump into some [go](https://go.dev/) code for that, but I ended up quickly scripting
it up in bash.  Despite the fact that said colleagues are awesome in go and other languages, some of them
never quite got into bash.  So I said I could write up some quick howto for future reference. Next question is
where to publish it.  Something publicly-accessible seemed to make the most sense, and hence the idea for this
site was born.

I know there are a bazillion tech blogs out there.  Probably the world doesn't really need one more,
especially since the probability of `$developer` in continuing to post content seems to be generally pretty
low. But hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  So, for now, let's see where this goes.
